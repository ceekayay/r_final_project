The data we are using comes from (Project FeederWatch)[https://feederwatch.org/explore/raw-dataset-requests/].

**FeederWatch** is citizen science survey of birds that visit backyards, nature centers, 
and community areas across North America. Birds are survey from November to April.

The data shows which bird species visit feeders, as well as location specific information 
about the feeder environment.

Project FeederWatch is operated by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Birds Canada.
