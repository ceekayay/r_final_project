The data we are using comes from (Project FeederWatch)[https://feederwatch.org/explore/raw-dataset-requests/].

**FeederWatch** is citizen science survey of birds that visit backyards, nature centers, 
and community areas across North America. Birds are survey from November to April.

The data shows which bird species visit feeders, as well as location specific information 
about the feeder environment.

Project FeederWatch is operated by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Birds Canada.

Our dashboard features three interactive elements:
1. A map showing 
2. A timeseries plot of bird sightings across the study period of 2021-2024. The user can select one of the top 25 most common birds to see their seasonal sightings.
3. A histogram showing total counts for all birds seen. The user can select the state that they wish to see counts for, as well as the year.

In order to knit the dashboard, please use the R markdown file labeled: final_dashboard. We hope you enjoy!
